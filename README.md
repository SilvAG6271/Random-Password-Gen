# Random-Password-Gen

## Description

App to generate a random password while using user input to determine characters used. Applied Javascript principles to code in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of how it works. I did get some help and combined it with code I had already written, I commented to help me break down the code and what it does.

## Usage

Use app to generate a random password for fun, probably not suitable for use for gaining a truly secure password. Push the red Generate Password button, answer the prompts and then get a random password generated for you.

## Credits

Source code was provided by "friendly-parakeet" at <https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet>. Also received massive coding help from a github I found, user name "njthanhtrang" at <https://github.com/njthanhtrang/3.-JavaScript-Challenge-Password-Generator/blob/master/script.js>. While I did already have portions of code written, the site helped me to understand better how to make the user input usable as I was having difficulty with that.
